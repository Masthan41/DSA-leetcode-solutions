#  LeetCode Solutions in Java
This repository contains my curated solutions to LeetCode problems implemented in **Java** as part of my Data Structures & Algorithms preparation for technical interviews. The goal of this repo is not just to solve problems, but to understand and document the **patterns** behind them such as recursion, backtracking, dynamic programming, and string/array manipulation.
A structured collection of LeetCode problems solved in Java with clean, optimized implementations.

Each solution includes:
- Problem number and link
- Brief explanation of the approach
- Time and space complexity analysis
- A standalone **main()** method for local execution and testing

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Recursion
- Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Strings & Arrays
- Two Pointers
- Pattern-based problem solving
- Trees
- Graphs
- Math problems And more

Each solution file also contains a `main()` function so it can be compiled and executed independently without requiring the LeetCode platform.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure
LeetCode/ → Backtracking/ | DP/ | Strings/ | Arrays/  
Each file follows the format: `LC<problem_number>_<problem_name>.java`  
Examples: `DP/LC91_DecodeWays.java`, `Backtracking/LC22_GenerateParentheses.java`


## Approach
Every solution includes the problem number, approach explanation, time & space complexity, and a clean Java implementation for easy revision.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Strengthen **Data Structures and Algorithms** fundamentals
- Practice writing clean and optimized Java code
- Improve problem-solving depth
- Maintain structured preparation for coding interviews

---

## Coding Standards

- Consistent naming conventions
- Optimized time and space complexity
- Edge cases handled
- Minimal and meaningful comments
- Self-contained executable solutions

---

## Language Used
Java

## 📈 Progress
I regularly update this repository as I solve more problems and learn new patterns.

## 🤝 Contributions
This is a personal learning repository, but suggestions and improvements are always welcome.
