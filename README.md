# 🚀 LeetCode Solutions in Java
This repository contains my curated solutions to LeetCode problems implemented in **Java** as part of my Data Structures & Algorithms preparation for technical interviews. The goal of this repo is not just to solve problems, but to understand and document the **patterns** behind them — such as recursion, backtracking, dynamic programming, and string/array manipulation.

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Recursion
- Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming (DP)
- Strings & Arrays
- Two Pointers
- Pattern-based problem solving

## 🗂️ Folder Structure
LeetCode/ → Backtracking/ | DP/ | Strings/ | Arrays/  
Each file follows the format: `LC<problem_number>_<problem_name>.java`  
Examples: `DP/LC91_DecodeWays.java`, `Backtracking/LC22_GenerateParentheses.java`

## 🧠 Approach
Every solution includes the problem number, approach explanation, time & space complexity, and a clean Java implementation for easy revision.

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository serves as a personal revision guide, a record of consistent DSA practice, and a demonstration of problem-solving skills for SWE/SDE roles.

## ✅ Language Used
Java

## 📈 Progress
I regularly update this repository as I solve more problems and learn new patterns.

## 🤝 Contributions
This is a personal learning repository, but suggestions and improvements are always welcome.

⭐ If you find this useful, feel free to star the repo!
